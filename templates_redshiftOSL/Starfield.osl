 * Starfield.sl -- Surface shader for a star field.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes a star field.  Best when used as a surface shader for the inside
 *   of a large sphere.
 * 
 * PARAMETERS:
 *   frequency          frequency of the stars
 *   intensity          how bright are the stars?
 *   Width            how wide is the point spread function?  i.e. larger
 *                      values make "wider" stars, but the look less round.
