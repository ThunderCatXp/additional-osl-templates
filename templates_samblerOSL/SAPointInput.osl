 * Various nodes use a vector input that you can manually set to an x,y,z
 * value if you don't input uv coordinates into them.
 * While we have a normal input that we can adjust using the ball for input
 * the values used are not displayed within the node editor making
 * it hard for someone to replicate settings from viewing a node tree screenshot.
 * This script simply allows the input to be visible for easy sharing.
